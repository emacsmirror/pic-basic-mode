This function is under developement, and for the time being only
Dim and Case items are handled.

Interting an item means:

* Add a `Case' or `Case Else' into a `Select ... End Select'
  block. **under construction** Pressing again toggles between
  `Case' and `Case Else'. `Case Else' is possible only if there
  is not already a `Case Else'.

* Split a Dim declaration over several lines. Split policy is
  that:

  - the split always occur just before or just after the
    declaration of the variable V such that the pointer is
    located over this declaration. For instance if the
    declaration is `V(2) as T' then pointer position maybe any
    `^' as follows:

       Dim X, V(2) As T, Y
              ^^^^^^^^^^^

  - the split being after or before `V(2) as T' decalration and
    the position of pointer after split depends on where the
    pointer was before the split:

    - if the pointer is over variable name (but with array size
      inclusive) like this:

       Dim X, V(2) As T, Y
              ^^^^

      then the split is as follows (split is before declaration
      and pointer goes to next line):

       Dim X
       Dim V(2) As T, Y
           ^

    - if the pointer is not over variable name like this:


       Dim X, V(2) As T, Y
                  ^^^^^^^

      then the split is as follows (split is after declaration
      and pointer remains on same line):

       Dim X, V(2) As T
                       ^
       Dim Y

* **under construction** Add an `Else' or `ElseIf ... Then' into
  an `If ... Then ... End If' block.  Pressing again toggles
  between `Else' and `ElseIf ... Then'.  `Else' is possible only
  if therei s not already an `Else'."
